# Contribute code or documentation
Our SDK is entirely open-source and we do accept pull-requests if you feel like taking a stab at fixing the bug and maybe adding your name to our commit history. Please mention
any relevant issue number in the pull request description.

We require pull-requests for code and documentation to be submitted against the `master` branch in order to review and run it in our gated build system. We try to maintain a high bar for code quality and maintainability, we insist on having tests associated with the code, and if necessary, additions/modifications to the requirement documents.

Also, have you signed the [Contribution License Agreement](https://cla.microsoft.com/) ([CLA](https://cla.microsoft.com/))? A friendly bot will remind you about it when you submit your pull-request.

**If your contribution is going to be a major effort, you should give us a heads-up first.** We have a lot of items captured in our backlog and we release every two weeks, so before you spend the time, just check with us to make sure your plans and ours are in sync.  Just open an issue on github.
